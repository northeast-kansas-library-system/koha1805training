Z39.50 results
-----------------

When you click on a Z39.50 result, the row is highlighted in a stronger color.  The "Card," "Marc," and "Import" links have been converted into a drop-down button (I don't like this and am looking at code to open the drop-down on hover instead of click).

Miscellaneous changes
=====================


Automatic suggestion purging - 13 months
----------------------------------------

Koha now has the ability to automatically delete patron suggestions after a certain length of time.  We currently have 884 suggestions in the system and several hundred of them are more than 13 months old.  Some date back to 2012.

We will turn on this new system preference and remove any suggestions that have been outstanding for more than 13 months.
